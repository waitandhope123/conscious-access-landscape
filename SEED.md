Context Seed

This framework originates from an attempt to treat certain normally dismissed witness reports (e.g., invariant NDE phenomenology and rare cases of sustained anomalous accuracy) as structured data rather than as evidence or belief.

The guiding assumption is conditional and limited:
If these reports are taken as accurate descriptions of experience or outcome, then what is the smallest, most constrained structure that can account for them without introducing mechanisms, metaphysics, or explanatory inflation?

The framework therefore prioritizes:
- regime separation over unified explanation,
- constraints and silence zones over capabilities,
- contraction of claims under scrutiny,
- and descriptive stability over interpretive completeness.

No claims are made regarding:
- ontology,
- physical processes,
- consciousness survival,
- nonlocal signaling,
- or undiscovered physics.

The framework is explicitly pre-instrumental. It is not designed to be tested, simulated, or operationalized with current scientific tools. Its purpose is to preserve recognizability and prevent overinterpretation should similar anomalies be encountered in the future.

Confidence in this work applies to the internal shape and constraint structure only, not to the existence, cause, or ultimate meaning of the phenomena described.

Further development is contingent entirely on external empirical or methodological advances.
