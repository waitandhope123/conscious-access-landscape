Scope and Limits

This repository documents a constrained phenomenological framework. Its purpose is to describe observed or reported patterns of conscious access as regimes with defined boundaries, invariants, and failure modes. It is not intended to establish truth claims beyond that descriptive role.

What This Framework Is
----------------------
- A phenomenological mapping of hypothetical regimes of conscious access
- A constraint-based description focused on limits, silence zones, and invariants
- A framework derived from pattern stability, not explanation
- Explicitly incomplete and conditional

What This Framework Is Not
--------------------------
This framework does not claim to be:

- A proof of the existence of any described regime
- A theory of consciousness
- A theory of mind or cognition
- An extension, correction, or replacement of physics
- Evidence for nonlocal signaling, hidden forces, or dimensions
- Evidence for survival, transmission, or metaphysical entities

No mechanisms, causal models, or ontological commitments are proposed.

Limits of the Data
------------------
The framework relies on:
- Invariant phenomenological reports (e.g., NDE patterns)
- First-hand constraint reports from rare individuals exhibiting sustained accuracy

It does not rely on:
- Controlled experimental replication
- Instrumental measurement
- Statistical population studies

As a result, conclusions are necessarily limited to descriptive structure and internal consistency.

Interpretive Discipline
-----------------------
Throughout this repository:
- Terms such as “access,” “landscape,” or “regime” are descriptive, not literal
- Metaphorical language is used only where necessary and is explicitly non-physical
- Absence of data is treated as silence, not hidden explanation

The framework favors contraction of claims over expansion. Any observation that would require adding new abilities, mechanisms, or explanatory layers should be treated as a reason to reject or revise the framework rather than extend it.

Status
------
This framework is considered frozen at its current descriptive level. Further development is not planned unless new data introduce constraints that materially change the structure described here.
