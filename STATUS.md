Framework Name:
Conscious Access Landscape (CAL)

Version:
CAL v1.0 (Descriptive Freeze)

Summary:
CAL is a constrained phenomenological framework describing hypothetical regimes of conscious access. The framework is considered descriptively saturated at its current level. No further expansion is planned without materially new data.

Completeness Estimates:
- CAL (overall framework): ~45–50%
- CLM (Localization Collapse Regime): ~85–90%
- SAR (Selective Access Regime): ~70–75%

Interpretation:
These percentages reflect descriptive completeness at the phenomenological level only. They do not imply empirical validation, physical grounding, or theoretical explanation.

Development Status:
Frozen.

The framework will not be expanded by:
- adding mechanisms or causal explanations
- proposing physical or metaphysical interpretations
- broadening scope or capabilities
- incorporating speculative extensions

Conditions for Reopening Development:
Work may resume only if one or more of the following occur:
- Independent identification of additional SAR-capable individuals with convergent constraints
- Discovery of a new regime that cannot be reduced to CLM or SAR
- Reliable observations that contradict listed falsifiers and require revision
- Emergence of new data types that materially constrain the framework
