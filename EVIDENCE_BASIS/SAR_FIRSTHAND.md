First-Hand SAR Constraint Summary

This document summarizes constraint information derived from direct reporting by individuals exhibiting sustained Selective Access Regime (SAR) characteristics. The purpose of this document is not to validate claims, but to extract internally consistent operational constraints that refine the SAR profile.

All descriptions are anonymized, non-narrative, and limited to features that remained stable under repeated questioning. Interpretive language has been minimized.

Rationale for Inclusion
-----------------------
Unlike CLM, which is identified through population-level phenomenology, SAR is rare, standing, and outcome-defined by accuracy rather than by subjective experience. As a result, first-hand constraint reports are necessary to refine SAR’s operational boundaries.

These reports were used only to:
- eliminate unsupported assumptions,
- identify non-capabilities,
- and define silence zones.

They were not used to expand scope or assert existence.

Observed Operational Characteristics
------------------------------------

Baseline Activity:
- SAR appears continuously active at a low level.
- Directed attention increases resolution and depth but does not activate access.
- Access may register events even when attention is elsewhere.

Target Switching:
- Switching between targets is clean and immediate.
- No blending, lag, or confusion observed.

Distance and Familiarity:
- Physical distance does not affect access.
- Familiarity with the target does not affect access.

Reference Conditions:
- Access is relational, not object-based.
- Intermediaries (e.g., photos, names) function only when they establish a valid referential link between conscious systems.
- Random or unlinked objects do not reliably produce access.

---

Accuracy Profile
----------------
- When SAR is active, accuracy is immediately apparent.
- No confirmed instances of incorrect information regarding present states or causally active past.
- Incorrectness is confined to future outcomes.
- Accuracy is binary: either clearly correct or absent.

Temporal Resolution:
- Exact dates, timestamps, and precise chronology are not reliably available.
- Relative timing (e.g., age ranges, life phases) may be accessible.
- Past access reflects causal relevance, not archival retrieval.

---

Access Content
--------------
- Access is pre-linguistic and structural.
- Thoughts are perceived as semantic configurations, not word-for-word content.
- Mixed or conflicting states are accessible without contradiction.
- Self-deception and narrative rationalization are bypassed.
- Access is described as direct seeing or knowing, not inference.

Past material appears only when it remains causally active in the present.

---

Non-Capabilities
----------------
SAR does not reliably provide:
- exact dates or names
- numerical specificity
- latent or asymptomatic medical conditions
- deterministic future outcomes
- trivia or non-salient factual details

Emotional intensity, moral significance, repetition, or observer expectation do not bias access.

---

Failure Modes
-------------
Primary observed boundary:
- Self–entanglement opacity: access is unreliable or silent when observer and target share strong constraint overlap (e.g., self-access, deeply entangled relationships).

No confirmed suppression due to:
- fatigue
- stress
- emotional state
- deception by the target
- intentional blocking

Where access is not structurally permitted, SAR remains silent rather than producing distortion.

---

Cross-Observer Notes
--------------------
Multiple independent individuals exhibiting SAR-like accuracy appear to access the same regime. They may emphasize different aspects of the same target while remaining mutually consistent, suggesting a shared access mode with individual salience weighting.

---

Limitations
-----------
These reports:
- are first-hand and qualitative,
- do not constitute proof,
- are not statistically representative,
- and cannot establish mechanism or ontology.

Their role is strictly to refine SAR constraints and eliminate unsupported interpretations.
