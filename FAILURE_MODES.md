Failure Modes and Boundaries

This document lists known and inferred failure modes within the Conscious Access Landscape (CAL) framework. Failure modes are treated as structural boundaries rather than errors, noise, or limitations of skill.

A failure mode is defined as a condition under which access becomes unavailable or undefined, not incorrect.

---

General Principle
-----------------
Within CAL, regimes do not degrade gradually. Where access is not structurally permitted, it becomes silent rather than producing partial or distorted output.

Failure modes therefore preserve accuracy by restricting access.

---

Localization Collapse Regime (CLM)
---------------------------------
CLM does not exhibit internal failure modes.

Observed properties:
- Entry and exit are discrete.
- Informational silence is invariant.
- No selective access is available by design.

CLM is considered failure-stable at the phenomenological level.

---

Selective Access Regime (SAR)
-----------------------------
SAR exhibits a small number of well-defined boundaries.

Primary Failure Mode:
- Self–Entanglement Opacity

Description:
- SAR does not reliably operate on the self.
- SAR may become silent for individuals with strong reciprocal emotional or relational entanglement with the observer (e.g., spouses in active conflict).
- This opacity reflects loss of observer–target separability rather than inaccuracy.

Observed Characteristics:
- Silence rather than incorrect output
- No gradual degradation
- No distortion or bias introduced

---

Non-Failure Conditions
----------------------
The following do not appear to suppress or distort SAR:

- Fatigue
- Stress
- Emotional state
- Cognitive load
- Deception by the target
- Intentional blocking or “shielding”
- Physical distance
- Familiarity or unfamiliarity

These factors are therefore excluded as failure causes.

---

Temporal Boundaries
-------------------
Temporal uncertainty is not treated as failure.

- Present access remains accurate.
- Past access is limited to causally active material.
- Future outcomes are unreliable and contingent.

Lack of future accuracy reflects structural indeterminacy rather than regime failure.

---

Interpretive Errors
-------------------
Narrative misinterpretation by observers or third parties is not considered a regime failure. The framework distinguishes between access-level output and post-hoc interpretation.

Misuse or overextension of SAR claims beyond defined constraints constitutes misuse of the framework, not a failure of SAR itself.

---

Summary
-------
Failure modes within CAL are minimal and sharply defined. Their presence increases structural stability by preventing overextension and preserving accuracy.
