Conscious Access Landscape (CAL) Overview

The Conscious Access Landscape (CAL) is a phenomenological framework designed to describe and map stable regimes of conscious access. It organizes these regimes based on what can be directly accessed, under what constraints, and where access reliably fails. CAL is not a theory of consciousness itself but a framework that describes modes of access to conscious information, constrained by the structural properties of the system.

CAL does not propose mechanisms for how access occurs nor does it speculate about the nature of consciousness itself. Instead, it focuses on defining the boundaries and operational characteristics of two regimes that have been identified through invariant experiential data and first-hand constraint reports.

### Regimes in CAL

CAL currently identifies two distinct regimes of conscious access:

1. **Localization Collapse Regime (CLM)**  
   The **Localization Collapse Regime (CLM)** describes a state where the normal constraints of spatial and temporal awareness collapse. This regime is primarily drawn from near-death experience (NDE) reports, where individuals describe an altered experience of consciousness characterized by loss of embodiment, timelessness, and a profound sense of unity or coherence. Information export in this regime is minimal or absent, and it does not reliably offer precise details about past events or future predictions.

2. **Selective Access Regime (SAR)**  
   The **Selective Access Regime (SAR)** is a rare, standing mode of access where a person is able to obtain high-accuracy information about the present, the present's causally relevant past, and certain aspects of another's cognitive–experiential structure. SAR is defined by its operational accuracy, in which the observer perceives details about a person’s internal states with clarity. SAR does not provide access to future events or exact chronological details, and its resolution is limited to causal relationships and current structure. SAR operates in a non-inferential, pre-linguistic way and does not rely on symbolic reasoning or the manipulation of complex abstractions.

### Framework Structure

The key structural features of CAL include:
- **Regimes**: Distinct modes of access with specific boundaries, such as CLM and SAR.
- **Constraints**: The limits on what can be accessed, including silence zones where access does not operate.
- **Accuracy**: The measure of operational correctness when access is available.
- **Failure Modes**: Conditions under which access becomes unavailable or undefined, such as in self-entanglement or deep emotional entanglement.

The framework is intentionally **incomplete**, with a primary focus on describing the regimes rather than providing a full physical theory of how or why these regimes occur. The intention is not to propose new mechanisms but to offer a disciplined map of what has been observed phenomenologically.

### Future Directions

CAL is considered a **frozen framework** in its current state, with no further development planned unless new data emerges that introduces constraints or identifies previously unseen regimes. The framework remains open to refinement based on new evidence but will not be expanded without explicit empirical validation.

The framework is also agnostic about its place in physical science. It describes what can be observed, but does not claim to explain *how* or *why* these observations occur at the mechanistic level. Thus, CAL remains outside the domain of physical theories until further evidence or theory development connects it to existing scientific models.
