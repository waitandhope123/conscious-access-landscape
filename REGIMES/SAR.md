Selective Access Regime (SAR)

The Selective Access Regime (SAR) is a rare, standing regime of conscious access identified by sustained, self-validating accuracy regarding present cognitive–experiential structure and causally relevant past. SAR is defined operationally by its constraints and accuracy profile rather than by subjective experience alone.

SAR preserves differentiation and agency and operates without reliance on inference, symbolic reasoning, or narrative interpretation.

---

Recognition Criterion
---------------------
SAR is recognized externally by sustained, exceptionally high accuracy. When active, correctness is immediately apparent and binary: access is either clearly correct or absent. No confirmed cases exist of SAR producing incorrect information about present states or causally active past.

Incorrectness is confined to future outcomes, which remain contingent and unreliable.

---

Activation and Attention
------------------------
SAR is baseline-active at a low level. Directed attention does not activate SAR but increases resolution and depth of access (“attentional zoom”).

- Access may register even when attention is elsewhere.
- Intentional focus sharpens detail without changing accuracy.
- Switching between targets is clean and immediate, with no lag or blending.

SAR is not effort-based and shows no dependence on fatigue, stress, or emotional state.

---

Access Level
------------
SAR accesses pre-linguistic cognitive structure rather than linguistic inner speech.

Observed properties:
- Meaning is perceived as semantic configuration, not word-for-word thought.
- Mixed or conflicting states are accessible without contradiction.
- Self-deception and narrative rationalization are bypassed.
- Access is experienced as direct seeing or knowing, not interpretation.

---

Informational Scope
-------------------
Present:
- Extremely high accuracy for current experiential, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral states.
- Surface bodily conditions (e.g., pain, tension, distress) are accessible.

Past:
- Accessible only insofar as past events remain causally active in the present.
- Access reflects developmental or structural relevance rather than chronological indexing.
- Exact dates or timestamps are not reliably available; relative timing (age ranges, life phases) may appear.

Future:
- Unreliable beyond present constraints.
- SAR may register current intent or directional momentum but does not access future facts.

Latent or deeply physical states (e.g., asymptomatic disease) are not reliably accessible.

Constraint and Salience Rules
-----------------------------
Salience is determined by causal activity, not by emotional intensity, moral significance, repetition, or observer expectation.

Intent is accessed as operative intent: the causally effective organization toward action, independent of conscious belief or declared narrative.

When multiple states are present, SAR selects the dominant active configuration rather than aggregating content.

---

Relational Reference
--------------------
SAR is relational rather than object-based.

- Physical distance and familiarity are irrelevant.
- Intermediaries (e.g., photos, names) function only insofar as they establish a valid referential link between conscious systems.
- Objects do not carry information themselves; random or unlinked objects do not reliably support access.

---

Failure Modes and Boundaries
----------------------------
SAR does not degrade internally. Its primary boundary condition is self–entanglement opacity.

Observed boundaries:
- SAR does not reliably operate on the self.
- SAR may become silent for targets with deep reciprocal entanglement with the observer (e.g., spouses in active conflict).
- Silence reflects structural non-separability rather than inaccuracy.

No confirmed suppression occurs due to deception, intentional blocking, emotional state, or observer condition.

---

Cross-Observer Notes
--------------------
Multiple independent individuals exhibiting SAR appear to access the same regime. They may emphasize different aspects of the same target while remaining mutually consistent, suggesting a shared access mode with individual salience weighting rather than idiosyncratic interpretation.

---

Completeness Assessment
-----------------------
SAR is well-characterized but empirically limited.

- Operational profile and constraints are clear.
- Boundaries and silence zones are defined.
- Further progress requires new data rather than additional theorizing.

Estimated completeness: ~70–75%

Interpretive Note
-----------------
SAR is described strictly phenomenologically. No claims are made regarding mechanisms, signals, energies, dimensions, or metaphysical interpretation. References to “frequency” or “alignment” are treated as non-physical metaphors for compatibility within constraint space.
