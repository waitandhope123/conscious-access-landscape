NDE-Derived Data Summary

This document summarizes the role of near-death experience (NDE) reports as a data source for the Localization Collapse Regime (CLM). Individual anecdotes are not treated as evidence; instead, emphasis is placed on invariant features that recur across large numbers of reports.

Rationale for Use
-----------------
NDE reports are used because they exhibit:
- High cross-cultural invariance
- Consistent boundary conditions (onset and return)
- Stable phenomenological features independent of belief systems
- Clear separation between experiential richness and informational silence

These properties make NDEs suitable for identifying regime-level patterns, not for validating metaphysical claims.

Method of Extraction
--------------------
The framework does not catalog individual narratives. Instead, it extracts only those features that remain stable across many reports, including those collected from diverse cultural, religious, and historical contexts.

Features were included only if they:
- Appeared consistently across unrelated accounts
- Were reported independently of interpretive framing
- Persisted regardless of prior expectations or belief

Features that varied widely or depended on cultural interpretation were excluded.

Invariant Features Identified
-----------------------------
Across NDE reports, the following features recur with high consistency:

- Loss of bodily localization
- Collapse or suspension of linear time
- Reduced differentiation of self and environment
- Strong experiential coherence
- Emotional neutrality or flattening
- Tunnel-like or narrowing phenomenology during transition
- Abrupt re-localization upon return

These features define the CLM phenomenological profile.

Informational Characteristics
-----------------------------
A critical invariant across NDE reports is the absence of reliable selective information:

- Precise factual details are rarely retained
- Past or future events are not consistently or verifiably accessed
- Information gained is typically symbolic, interpretive, or experiential rather than factual

This informational silence is treated as a defining structural property of CLM rather than as a failure or limitation.

Exclusions
----------
The following are explicitly excluded from consideration:
- Claims of veridical perception during NDEs
- Religious or metaphysical interpretations
- Symbolic imagery treated as literal information
- Post-hoc narrative elaboration

Such elements vary widely and do not contribute to regime identification.

Role in CAL
-----------
NDE-derived invariants are used solely to characterize the Localization Collapse Regime. They are not used to support claims regarding survival, nonlocal perception, or selective access.

CLM and SAR are treated as distinct regimes. NDE data informs CLM only and does not directly support the existence or properties of SAR.

Limitations
-----------
NDE reports are self-reported and retrospective. While invariance supports regime identification, NDE data alone cannot establish mechanisms, causality, or ontological interpretation.

Their role in CAL is limited to descriptive pattern extraction.
