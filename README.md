Conscious Access Landscape (CAL)

A constrained phenomenological framework describing hypothetical regimes of conscious access, including localization collapse and selective access, derived from invariant experiential data and first-hand constraint reports. This project does not propose mechanisms, new physics, or metaphysical claims, and is explicitly limited to descriptive structure, boundaries, and failure modes.

Overview
--------
The Conscious Access Landscape (CAL) is a descriptive framework intended to map stable patterns of conscious access as regimes within a non-spatial landscape. It is concerned with what can be accessed, under what constraints, and where access reliably fails. CAL does not attempt to explain why these regimes exist or how they might be implemented physically.

Two regimes are currently described:

- Localization Collapse Regime (CLM): A boundary-collapse regime characterized by loss of differentiation and informational silence, primarily derived from invariant near-death experience (NDE) reports.
- Selective Access Regime (SAR): A rare, standing access regime identified by sustained, self-validating accuracy regarding present cognitive–experiential structure and causally relevant past.

Scope
-----
This repository documents structure only. It intentionally avoids:
- claims of proof or validation
- proposed mechanisms or causal explanations
- extensions to existing physics
- metaphysical or ontological assertions

CAL should be read as a constrained phenomenological map, not as a theory of mind, consciousness, or reality.

Current Status
--------------
- CAL (overall framework): ~45–50% complete
- CLM (Localization Collapse Regime): ~85–90% complete
- SAR (Selective Access Regime): ~70–75% complete

Development of this framework is considered frozen unless new, materially different data become available.
