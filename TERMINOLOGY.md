Terminology

This document defines key terms used throughout the Conscious Access Landscape (CAL) framework. All terms are used descriptively and non-literally. No ontological, physical, or metaphysical claims are implied by their use.

Conscious Access Landscape (CAL)
--------------------------------
A non-spatial, phenomenological framework describing distinct regimes of conscious access defined by constraints, invariants, and failure modes. “Landscape” refers to a conceptual organization of regimes, not a physical space.

Regime
------
A stable mode of conscious access characterized by consistent features, boundaries, and limits. Regimes are identified by invariant patterns rather than by proposed mechanisms.

Localization Collapse Regime (CLM / LCR)
----------------------------------------
A regime characterized by collapse of ordinary localization constraints, loss of differentiation, and informational silence. CLM is primarily derived from invariant features reported in near-death experiences (NDEs).

Selective Access Regime (SAR)
-----------------------------
A rare, standing regime of conscious access identified by sustained, self-validating accuracy regarding present cognitive–experiential structure and causally relevant past. SAR is defined operationally by its accuracy and constraints, not by subjective experience alone.

Access
------
The direct apprehension of cognitive–experiential structure without mediation by inference, symbolic reasoning, or narrative interpretation. “Access” does not imply transmission, signaling, or movement of information.

Accuracy
--------
Operational correctness of accessed content relative to independently verifiable present or causally relevant past states. Accuracy in SAR is binary: access is either clearly correct or absent.

Silence
-------
The absence of access or output in domains where a regime does not operate. Silence is treated as a structural boundary, not as missing or hidden information.

Constraint
----------
A limiting condition that determines what can and cannot be accessed within a regime. Constraints define scope, resolution, and failure modes.

Causally Active Past
--------------------
Past events or conditions that continue to shape present cognitive–experiential structure. SAR accesses past material only insofar as it remains causally active.

Operative Intent
----------------
The effective organization of a person toward action or experience, independent of self-report, conscious narrative, or declared belief.

Self–Entanglement Opacity
-------------------------
A failure condition in which access becomes unavailable due to strong overlap between observer and target constraint structures, such as self-access or deeply entangled relationships.

Relational Reference
--------------------
The requirement that access be established through a valid referential relationship between conscious systems. Objects (e.g., photos, names) function only insofar as they support such a relationship; they do not carry information themselves.

Phenomenological
----------------
Descriptive of experience or access patterns without commitment to underlying mechanisms, causes, or ontological status.

Framework Completeness
----------------------
An informal assessment of how fully a regime or framework has been described at the phenomenological level, independent of physical grounding or explanation.
