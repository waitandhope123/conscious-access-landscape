Localization Collapse Regime (CLM)

The Localization Collapse Regime (CLM), also referred to as the Localization Collapse Regime (LCR), describes a stable boundary condition in which ordinary constraints of localization, differentiation, and temporal sequencing collapse. This regime is primarily derived from invariant features reported in near-death experiences (NDEs).

CLM is characterized not by the acquisition of information, but by the collapse of the structures that ordinarily support selective access. Informational silence is a defining feature of this regime.

---

Core Characteristics
--------------------
CLM exhibits the following invariant features across reports:

- Loss of bodily localization and embodied perspective
- Collapse or suspension of linear time
- Strong experiential coherence with reduced differentiation
- Emotional neutrality or flattening
- Tunnel-like or narrowing phenomenology during transition
- Abrupt re-localization upon return

These features appear consistently across cultural, religious, and personal contexts, suggesting a stable regime rather than narrative variation.

Informational Properties
------------------------
CLM does not reliably support the acquisition or export of selective factual information.

Observed properties include:
- Absence of precise factual recall upon return
- Lack of reliable past or future detail
- No consistent retrieval of personal or external data
- Strong experiential clarity without informational specificity

This informational silence is treated as structural rather than incidental.

Boundary Conditions
-------------------
CLM appears at sharp boundary events involving loss or suspension of ordinary conscious localization, such as near-death states. Entry into CLM is abrupt, and exit typically coincides with rapid restoration of bodily and temporal localization.

CLM does not exhibit gradual degradation or partial activation. The regime is entered or exited discretely.

Relation to Other Regimes
-------------------------
CLM is structurally incompatible with regimes that preserve differentiation and selective access. In particular:

- CLM does not involve Selective Access Regime (SAR)
- CLM does not support factual accuracy or discriminative perception
- CLM is not a precursor state for SAR within the same episode

While near-death experiences may correlate with later emergence of SAR in some individuals, CLM itself does not include SAR-level access.

---

Completeness Assessment
-----------------------
CLM is considered largely complete at the phenomenological level.

- Invariant features are well-established
- Boundaries are clearly defined
- Failure modes are minimal and consistent
- No additional explanatory structure is required

Estimated completeness: ~85–90%

Interpretive Note
-----------------
CLM is described strictly phenomenologically. No claims are made regarding ontological interpretation, survival, non-physical entities, or physical mechanisms. Descriptions of unity, light, or transcendence are treated as experiential qualities rather than explanatory constructs.
