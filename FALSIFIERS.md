Falsifiers

This document lists explicit conditions that would invalidate or require revision of the Conscious Access Landscape (CAL) framework or its constituent regimes. These are not challenges to be met, but boundaries beyond which the framework should be rejected or materially revised.

A falsifier is defined as an observation that contradicts a core invariant or boundary condition of the framework.

---

Framework-Level Falsifiers (CAL)
--------------------------------
CAL would be invalidated or require major revision if any of the following were reliably observed:

- Discovery of a third regime that overlaps or contradicts both CLM and SAR without clear boundary separation
- Evidence that access operates via physical signaling, energy transfer, or spatial mediation
- Reliable operation of access that violates stated silence zones without introducing new constraints
- Necessity to introduce ad-hoc mechanisms to preserve coherence

---

Localization Collapse Regime (CLM) Falsifiers
---------------------------------------------
CLM would be falsified or require revision if:

- CLM reliably produced verifiable selective factual information
- CLM showed gradual degradation or partial activation
- CLM varied significantly across cultural or belief contexts in its core invariants
- CLM supported discriminative perception or narrative-level access

---

Selective Access Regime (SAR) Falsifiers
----------------------------------------
SAR would be falsified or require revision if any of the following occurred reliably:

Accuracy Violations:
- SAR produces clearly incorrect information about present states
- SAR produces incorrect information about causally active past
- SAR exhibits partial correctness or probabilistic guessing patterns

Temporal Violations:
- SAR reliably provides exact dates, timestamps, or chronological indexing
- SAR reliably predicts future events beyond present constraints

Boundary Violations:
- SAR reliably operates on the self
- SAR reliably operates under strong observer–target entanglement without opacity
- SAR degrades gradually rather than becoming silent

Bias Violations:
- Emotional intensity, moral salience, repetition, or expectation biases access
- Deception by the target reliably blocks or distorts access

Reference Violations:
- SAR operates reliably through unlinked objects or random intermediaries
- Physical distance or familiarity alters accuracy

---

Methodological Violations
-------------------------
The framework should be rejected or revised if:

- Explanatory mechanisms must be introduced to preserve internal consistency
- Claims expand in response to contradiction rather than contract
- Silence is reinterpreted as hidden information rather than structural boundary

---

Interpretive Note
-----------------
These falsifiers are intentionally conservative. Their purpose is to prevent inflation of scope and to preserve structural discipline. Observations that merely add detail without violating constraints do not constitute falsification.

The absence of falsification does not imply validation.
